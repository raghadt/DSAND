Time Analysis for project #1:

Task #0:
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
Explanation: This is a direct solution of accessing a list via an index

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task #1:
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
Explanation: This is a direct solution of accessing a list via an index

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task #1:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
Explanation: There are two seperate for loop, meaning the time will be at worst case (n) because we have to loop through all items in a list.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task #2:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
Explanation: for loop was used along with max() function, at worst case it will be of time (n)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task #3:
Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
Explanation: although no double loops were used, yet sorted() function was used which is (nlogn)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task #4:
Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
Explanation: although no double loops were used, yet sorted() function was used which is (nlogn)
