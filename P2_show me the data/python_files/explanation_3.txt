Solution #3 Explaination:

for this solution, a dictionary of generated encoding were mapped to the letter depending on its order.
dictionary is direct access, linear for loop were used as well

Time complexity: O(1) + O(n) = O(n), where n is the size of the sentence list.
Space complexity: O(m), where m is the size unique characters in the sentences.
